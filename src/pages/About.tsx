                    I'm a web developer who loves turning ideas into real digital experiences. I started out with small projects that eventually sparked a passion for building things that not only work smoothly but also feel personal. I work a lot with React, TypeScript, and full-stack development, always aiming for solutions that are practical, scalable, and friendly to users.
                    <br /><br />
                    I've spent years learning how to design clean, intuitive interfaces and build robust systems that operate seamlessly behind the scenes. This journey has taught me to appreciate the blend of art and logic in coding – solving complex problems with elegant solutions.
                    <br /><br />
                    My goal is to create digital experiences that meet real needs while connecting with people on a human level. Every line of code is a step towards making that vision a reality.
